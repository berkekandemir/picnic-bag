# picnic-bag
This Java program mimics a picnic bag. The main objective is to implement a bag data structure. This was a group project, but the whole implementation belongs to me.

Program is not working. There is mistakes and I did not fix them. This was my first Java project and I left it like this to see how I improved myself in time.
